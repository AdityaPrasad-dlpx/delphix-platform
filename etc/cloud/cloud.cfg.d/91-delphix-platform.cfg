# While we create the user using Ansible, we need to inform cloud-init
# of this user so that SSH keys are properly inserted into this user's
# authorized_keys file (e.g. when running in EC2). Additionally, this
# will prevent cloud-init from creating the default user.

# Without this setting, /etc/hosts will be empty. This allows cloud-init

#
# Since we're running on a ZFS-on-root installation, the "resizefs" and

# Disable cloud-init from manipulating the APT sources. We don't want
# the Delphix appliance to rely on packages from any 3rd party sources
# (e.g. Ubuntu's APT repositories), so we need to ensure cloud-init does
# not try to configure the APT sources to point to Ubuntu's servers.
