This file is temporarily maintained for backwards compatibility of
programs that will attempt to install ansible configuration into this
directory. Originally, /etc/delphix-platform/ansible was the directory
used for storing ansible configuration consumed by the delphix-platform
service, but this has since moved to /var/lib/delphix-platform to better
comply with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
