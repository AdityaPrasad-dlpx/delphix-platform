# During system shutdown, /var/log will attempt to be unmounted (due to
# us using a seperate dataset for that directory, and using /etc/fstab
# to mount it), and that unmount will fail with EBUSY. That EBUSY is a
# result of systemd-journald logging to /var/log/journal while the
# unmount is attempted. To avoid this unmount failure, we're using the
# "lazy unmount" option, which allows the unmount to succeed, but delays
# the actual detachment of the mountpoint until all references to that
# mountpoint are dropped (i.e. until systemd-journald stops).
