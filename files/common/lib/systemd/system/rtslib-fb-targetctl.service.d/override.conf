# During upgrade verification, the root filesystem will be booted as a
# container using systemd-nspawn. When the rtslib-fb-targetctl service
# runs in this container, it can cause corruption of the iSCSI volumes
# on the host (due to us allowing all capabilities to the container).
# Thus, to workaround this problem, we explicitly disable this service
# from running when inside of the container.

# Although delphix-migration already defines a RequiredBy dependency on
# rtslib-fb-targetctl, that dependency is only honored when delphix-migration
# is enabled. If delphix-migration was manually disabled before migration
# completed, we still want to prevent rtslib-fb-targetctl from running, so
# it is done with this check. Note that "ConditionPathExists" is not a
# valid alternative since the result of the check doesn't prevent
# rtslib-fb-targetctl's dependencies from running.
